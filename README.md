# Rust Playground
The code I made while learning basic Rust concepts.

## Main References
1. https://www.rust-lang.org/learn (choose what you need)
2. https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro (enough detail but maybe not as a primary reference)
3. https://tourofrust.com (simple but some important concepts are skipped)

## Compiling and Running Rust
- Compile and run simple Rust project: `rustc <file_name>.rs && <file_name>`
- Create project using Cargo (for bigger project): `cargo new <project_name>`
- Build and run code with Cargo: `cargo run` (no need for `cargo build`)
- Check code without building it: `cargo check`

## Todo
- [x] Make simple input output prompt
- [x] Test flow control (if else, match, etc)
- [x] Test loop and break (for, while)
- [x] Implement simple OOP case
- [ ] Make exercise template like rustlings?
